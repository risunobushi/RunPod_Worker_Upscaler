Based on runpod-worker-comfy: https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-comfyui.

This repo is a simple Docker image for RunPod Serverless aimed to leverage SEEDVR2 for image upscaling.
It could still do videos, theoretically, but I only tested it for still images.

To test it, upload a image.png test image, either run the .bat or the test .py file, and input your endpoint ID and API Keys.
